Challenges:
- Git knowledge
- Framework knowledge
- Environment Issues
--------------------------

Friday
- focused on learning how to use Git after work

Saturday
(morning)
- continued learning Git and how to interact with GitHub
- found a Git Repo for a Basic Task List example in Laravel (quickstart), but I don't want to use this solution (I have not looked at it yet, just wanted to document that I found a solution)


(late afternoon):
- worked with XAMPP to find and update PHP
- began Laravel videos
- installation of Composer and Laravel
- troubleshoot Laravel error when creating a project:
   Problem 1
   - laravel/framework[v8.12.0, ..., 8.x-dev] require league/flysystem ^1.1 -> satisfiable by league/flysystem[1.1.0, ..., 1.x-dev].
   - league/flysystem[1.1.0, ..., 1.x-dev] require ext-fileinfo * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's fileinfo extension.
   - Root composer.json requires laravel/framework ^8.12 -> satisfiable by laravel/framework[v8.12.0, ..., 8.x-dev].
  *** Solution: edit PHP.ini to include: extension=php_fileinfo.dll 

(night):
- create GitHub repository, Local Git Repository, and push Local to GitHub

Sunday
(morning)
- review exercise and begin design on paper - not knowing/understanding the framework makes it difficult to determine what parts I will have to write and what may already exist in a library.

- started a basic app tutorial, but have been struggling all day with the Laravel environment requirements
- I have XAMPP already installed with mySQL and PHP for my class. Today I am having issues with the 'php artisan migrate' command throwing PDO errors.
- I have been all over StackOverflow and Google looking for solution.
   * I have verified that PHP and mySQL are installed and working.
   * I have run "mysql -u root" and then "use tutorial_db" successfully (tutorial_db is the database I created for the tutorial)
   * I have verified settings in the configuration files (php.ini, .env, etc.), Windows PATHs, enabled the 'dll' extension, but I cannot get past this, so I'm stopping for the day. (I have been at it since 8:00 this morning.)
 
 (3:30 PM)
   My impediment today was my development environment setup hampering my ability to learn more about Laravel through the "create an application" tutorial.

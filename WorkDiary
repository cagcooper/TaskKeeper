Challenges:
- Git knowledge
- Framework knowledge
- Environment Issues
--------------------------

Friday
- focused on learning how to use Git after work

Saturday
(morning)
- continued learning Git and how to interact with GitHub
- found a Git Repo for a Basic Task List example in Laravel (quickstart), but I don't want to use this solution (I have not looked at it yet, just wanted to document that I found a solution)


(late afternoon):
- worked with XAMPP to find and update PHP
- began Laravel videos
- installation of Composer and Laravel
- troubleshoot Laravel error when creating a project:
   Problem 1
   - laravel/framework[v8.12.0, ..., 8.x-dev] require league/flysystem ^1.1 -> satisfiable by league/flysystem[1.1.0, ..., 1.x-dev].
   - league/flysystem[1.1.0, ..., 1.x-dev] require ext-fileinfo * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's fileinfo extension.
   - Root composer.json requires laravel/framework ^8.12 -> satisfiable by laravel/framework[v8.12.0, ..., 8.x-dev].
  *** Solution: edit PHP.ini to include: extension=php_fileinfo.dll 

(night):
- create GitHub repository, Local Git Repository, and push Local to GitHub

Sunday
(morning)
- review exercise and begin design on paper
